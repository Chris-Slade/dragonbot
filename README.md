A chatbot written in Python 3.x for [Discord](discordapp.com).

This bot uses the
[discord.py](http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) framework.

The `3.1` in the repository name is not the actual bot version, but is a
reference to my previous "DragonBots," the first of which was a HexChat plugin
for use in IRC and the second of which was a bot for Hitbox.tv that ended up
going nowhere. The `.1` is because this is the second remote repository for
this iteration of DragonBot; the first repository no longer exists.
